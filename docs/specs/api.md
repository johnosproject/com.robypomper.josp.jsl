Once initialize, the JSL library provide you an instance of the [JSL](#jsl)
object. From this object, you can access to different sub-systems:

* [Objects Manager](#objects-manager): list JOSP Objects and return [RemoteObject](#remote-objects) instances to interact with
* [Communication](#communication): manage JOSP Service connection to the JOSP Objects and the JCP
* [User Manager](#user-manager): handle current user profile
* [Service Info](#service-info): return current JOSP Service info
* [Admin](#admin): access to JCP Admin features (reserved for Management JOSP Service)

The JSL library provide also the [JSL Shell](shell.md). An interactive shell
used to test environments and objects via command line interface.
