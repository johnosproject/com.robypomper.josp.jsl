# JOSP Object Daemon - Specs: JOD Info

The `com.robypomper.josp.jsl.info` package contains a single class, `JSLInfo`,
that provides the JOD Agent with the information about the JSL Shell itself.

Here the list of constants provided by the `JSLInfo` class:
* `APP_NAME`: the short name for the agent (`JSLShell`)
* `APP_NAME_FULL`: the long name for the agent (`JOSP Service Library's shell`)
